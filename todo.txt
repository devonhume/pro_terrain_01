To-Do:

Pipeline Rewrite:
	
-	New Node Types
	-	Terrain Feature
		-	Mountains
		-	Depressions
		-	Coastline
	-	Biome
		-	

-	Reorganize into pipeline 

	-	Each Landscape Feature as a Node
	-	Code iterates through a list of Features and adds them
	-	'Make Mountains' as a 'Roughness' Node

-	Structured vertex list
-	Gui map features as individual objects added to pipeline 

	-	pipeline as expandable scrollable list
	-	each pops up exposing parameters
	-	add new landforms menu

-	Use seed for random generator
	-	Master Seed parameter on Terrain Generator node
	-	Each feature has the option to us it's own seed or the master seed
	
-	Savable ‘levels’ that can be called into an existing game
-	Two modes -
		1. gross generation - new seed, regens all features
		2. Fine generation - uses saved seed, changes / adds details

Landscape Features:
	
-	Each node should accept a biome node
- 	Pathing for Ranges, Canyons, Roads, Rivers

-	Terrain Path
	-	start point and end point
	-	optional between points
	-	depth, width, and path-deviation variance
	- 	scatters feature points along path
	-	option to follow existing 
	

-	Mountains/hills
	-	Single mountain 
	-	Range shapes, extents
	-	Range uses Terrain Path to make line of single mountains
	-	Craters:
		- change to create single mountains in ring
		- multiple origins to surround

- 	Depressions
	-	Lakes/ponds
		- Fill level
	-	Rivers/streams:
		- Option to "flow downstream"
		- Auto Waterfall Option
		- Flowrate Slider
		- Auto pond/lake
		- Detects when it hits existing water body

-	Coastline
	-	Land limits 
	-	Beach Frequency
	
-	Roads 
	-	Have a road texture
	-	uses Terrain Path
	-	Find "passes" in mountains
	-	Threshold to create ramps or switchbacks
	
-	Caves / dungeons 
	-	This is going to be a whole-ass thing
	
-	Flat areas / clearings 
	-	Height to make plateaus
	-	Make Additive to smooth
	- 	Slope
	
-	Feature linking
	-	Boolean Operations
		- Additive: Highest
		- Subtractive: Lowest
		- Average: Average of all values
		- Overwrite: Current Value
	
-	Waterfalls 
-	Clouds
-	Buildings? 
-	Irregular shapes
	- slider for irregularity
-	Better bumps
-	Procedural trees

Shaders / rendering:

-	Texture mapping to angles/objects 

	- Implemented shader from YouTube tutorial
		- Mapping by height IS working
		- Mapping by face slope needs fixing - is currently acting like mapping by height
	
-	Foliage shader
-	Biomes
	-	Biomes should be individual nodes that have their own shaders
	-	Includes a vegetation generator
-	Line-of-sight generation
-	Visibility by viewport 
-	Distance simplification 
-	Distance fog

Assets:
	
-	Terrain Asset
	-	holds an asset and places at locatio
	-	should have y value relative to ground
	- 	should adjust y value to ground changes

-	Asset Spawners
	-	inherits Terrain Asset
	- 	has default/changeable mesh, optional
	- 	contains asset to spawn
	-	define spawn trigger
	
-	Player Spawner
	-	like Asset Spawner but starts player at or teleports player to spawner location
	-	should add functionality to teleport character to a different spawner or a set location

Other Features:

-	Integrate gui with Godot editor
	- inpector groups
	
-	Origin marker 

		* DONE!
		
-	Place marker

		* Markers Placed
		* Buttons added, teleports to marker
		* Markers and Buttons hide on HideMarkersButton pressed
		
		- Click on marker to change Name, Color, Delete
		
- 	Implement 3rd Person Testing
		- Add option for custom char model
		- Add option for custom physics

Investigate
	- Nuget Packages?
	- sparse arrays
