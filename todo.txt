To-Do:

Pipeline Rewrite:

-	Reorganize into pipeline 
-	Structured vertex list
-	Gui map features as individual objects added to pipeline 
-	Use seed for random generator
-	Savable ‘levels’ that can be called into an existing game
-	Two modes -
		1. gross generation - new seed, regens all features
		2. Fine generation - uses saved seed, changes / adds details

Landscape Features:

-	Roads 
-	Single mountain 
-	Range shapes, extents
-	Land limits 
-	Feature linking 
-	Waterfalls 
-	Clouds
-	Flat areas / clearings 
-	Lakes/ponds
-	Rivers/streams
-	Coastline 
-	Caves / dungeons 
-	Buildings? 
-	Irregular shapes
-	Better bumps
-	Procedural trees

Shaders / rendering:

-	Texture mapping to angles/objects 

	So texture mapping different textures onto the same mesh should happen in the shaders -
	In the vertex shader, you can set the transparency by height. Each VERTEX is a "pixel" drawn on the mesh
	If you want to map by triangle, you can send an array of just the triangles you want mapped to the shader (I think)
	You should be able to map by slope by converting the normal?
	
-	Foliage shader
-	Biomes
-	Line-of-sight generation
-	Visibility by viewport 
-	Distance simplification 
-	Distance fog

Other Features:

-	Spawn point 
-	Integrate gui with Godot editor
-	Asset spawners
-	Origin marker 
-	Place marker
